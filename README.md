SparkFun <PRODUCT NAME> Particle Photon Library
===============================================

This is a library for the SparkFun BME280 Humidity, Barometric Pressure + Temp sensor

Particle Photon & Core DHT Library based on Sparkfun Arduino Library for BME280 sensors adapted by Markus Haack

v1.0.0, October 2015 Initial Release

Designed specifically to work with the [*SparkFun BME280 (SEN-13676)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13676)

Works with the following BME280-Breakouts as well:
 * http://www.watterott.com/en/BME280-Breakout-humidity-pressure-temperature-sensor
 * http://www.adafruit.com/products/2652

This library allows the user to:

* Read pressure in Pa
* Read temperature in C
* Read humidity in %RH

It also provides the following mathematical functions based from the above.

* Read temperature in F
* Read altitude in meters
* Read altitude in feet
